# Running

1. First, run `yarn install` in the project root directory.

    *This is necessary because the example uses `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-mathlive` from the root in order to facilitate manually testing development changes.*
2. Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in this directory, `/example`.

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
